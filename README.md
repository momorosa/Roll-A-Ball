# Roll-A-Ball

"Roll-a-ball" is a basic Unity project for practicing fundamental concepts. It features a square stage where a ball rolls, collects items and is navigated using WASD keys. An input manager and camera controls are programmed using Unity, C#, and linear algebra. The camera tracks the ball from a fixed distance and elevation, and a 360-degree field of view is achieved via right mouse click.
